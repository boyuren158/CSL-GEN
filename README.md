Cross-validation Approaches for Multi-study Predictions

* **Fig3a_Fig4.R**: R script to generate the asymptotitic rate figures and the relative performance comparisons between DR and CVCS.

* **Fig3bc.R**: R script to generate the bias and variance plots of various utilty estimators.

* **Fig3def.R** R script to generate the contour plots and the prediction prjection plot for the comparisions between CVCS and CVWS.

* **app.R** R script to perform the data application.
